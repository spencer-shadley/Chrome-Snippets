I was curious what the weighted interest on my student loans was so I wrote this script...probably overkill but yeah...

The script checks myfedloan.org for the current loan balances, interest rates, loan total and the overall weighted interest.

Script assumes you are on the ["Print All Loan Details"](https://accountaccess.myfedloan.org/accountAccess/index.cfm?event=loan.getloanDetails&row=all&loanRegion=FD) page

I run this as a Chrome snippet for easy access.
