# loanInfo.js

I was curious what the weighted interest on my student loans was so I wrote this script...

The script checks myfedloan.org for the current loan balances, interest rates, loan total and the overall weighted interest. The script makes it easy to check which loan to payoff next (it prints a table of the remaining loans sorted by interest rate.)

Script assumes you are on the ["Print All Loan Details"](https://accountaccess.myfedloan.org/accountAccess/index.cfm?event=loan.getloanDetails&row=all&loanRegion=FD) page.

I run this as a Chrome snippet for easy access.

# chaseTotal.js

From your Chase transactions this will total all listed transactions.

Note: This can be combined with Chase's "Search" function to get more interesting data.
